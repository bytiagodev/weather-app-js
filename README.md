✨ About this project

This project started as a logic-focused exercise to fetch and display real-time weather data. Now it also has a simple but visually clear UI with dynamic backgrounds and weather icons. The focus is on clean, readable, and interactive frontend code.

🧠 What I learned

Chained API Calls: Requesting geolocation first, then fetching weather data.

Dynamic DOM Updates: Showing temperature, wind, and weather icons without refreshing the page.

Variable Fonts & Typography: Using Satoshi Variable for clean, readable text.

CSS Effects & Transitions: Implementing glass-like frosted containers and smooth color changes.

Responsive Layouts: Making the container centered and readable on multiple screen sizes.

🛠️ Tech Stack

HTML5 (Semantic structure)

CSS3 (Flexbox, transitions, glass effect)

Vanilla JavaScript (Fetch API, async data handling)

Open-Meteo API (Geocoding & Forecast)
