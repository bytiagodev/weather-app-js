🌤️ Weather App (In Progress)
A minimalist weather application built with Vanilla JavaScript that fetches real-time data using the Open-Meteo API.

Note: This project is currently in the logic-first phase. I am focusing on API integration and data handling before moving on to advanced UI/UX styling.

🚀 Current Features
Dynamic Geocoding: Converts city names into coordinates automatically.
Real-time Data: Fetches temperature and wind speed.
Variable Font Integration: Optimized typography using Satoshi Variable.
Asynchronous Logic: Efficiently handles multiple API calls using the Fetch API.

🛠️ Tech Stack
HTML5 (Semantic structure)
CSS3 (Typography and layout basics)
JavaScript ES6+ (Fetch API, Promises, Template Literals)
Open-Meteo API (Geocoding & Forecast)

🚧 Roadmap (Next Steps)
The project is intentionally "under construction" as I plan to implement:
Glassmorphism UI: A modern, clean interface.
Dynamic Backgrounds: Background colors that change based on weather conditions.
Weather Icons: Visual representation of weather codes (sunny, rainy, etc.).
Error UI: Custom on-screen alerts instead of browser pop-ups.

🧠 Technical Learnings
In this phase, I focused on:
Chained API Calls: Requesting coordinates first, then using that data for the weather forecast.
Performance: Implementing .woff2 variable fonts for faster loading.
Clean Code: Keeping logic separated and using modern JS syntax.
